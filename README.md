📚 Console-Based Library Management System

🔍 Project Snapshot
This project is a production-minded, console-based Library Management System engineered to demonstrate solid backend fundamentals, clean architecture,
and real-time database interaction. Built with scalability and clarity in mind

🧑🏼‍💻 Technical Stack

Language: Java ☕

Database: MySQL 🗄️

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3.2 ⚙️

🎯 Core Functionalities
This system covers the non-negotiable pillars of any library workflow:

🔎 Search Book – Fast lookup, no guesswork

📤 Issue Book – Controlled issuance with availability checks

📥 Return Book – Clean status updates, zero ambiguity

✅ Check Book Availability – Real-time verification backed by the database

🗃️ Data Management

All records are persisted in MySQL

Entries are stored, updated, and retrieved at runtime

Ensures data consistency and integrity across operations

All the entries are stored and are updated at a run time we have used mysql databse for that 

The project follows a clear, modular structure, separating concerns such as:

UI (console interaction)

Service logic

Database connectivity

This makes the codebase:

Easier to debug 🛠️

Easier to extend 📈

Easier to explain in interviews 😎
